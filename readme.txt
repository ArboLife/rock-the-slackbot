Rock The Slackbot helps you stay on top of changes by sending notifications straight to you and your team inside your Slack account.

== Description ==

= What is Slack? =
[Slack](https://slack.com/is) is a team collaboration tool that offers chat rooms organized by topic, as well as private groups and direct messaging. It's a great way to be productive with your team without clogging up your inbox.

= What is A Slackbot? =
[Slackbot](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202026038-Slackbot-your-assistant-notepad-programmable-bot) is Slack's built-in robot, which helps us send messages to you and your team inside your Slack account.

= Why Rock The Slackbot? =
Because it can help you manage your websites, and stay on top of changes, by sending notifications (following numerous WordPress events) to your Slackbot who will pass them along to a channel or direct message in your Slack account.

**Rock the Slackbot sends customizable notifications** for the following events:

* When a post is published
* When a post is unpublished
* When a post is updated
* When a post is deleted
* When a post is trashed
* When a 404 error is thrown
* When a menu item is deleted
* When media is added
* When media is edited
* When media is deleted
* When a user is added
* When a user is deleted
* When WordPress core is updated
* When a plugin is updated
* When a theme is updated

**I'm working to add the following events:**

* When menu item is added
* When a plugin, theme, or core update is available
* When a new comment is added or is awaiting moderation
* When a user's role is changed
* When plugins or themes are uploaded
* When plugins or themes are activated

**Each event can be customized to allow you to send different event notifications to different Slack channels**, e.g. you can send core, theme and plugin updates to your "wp-development" channel while all of your post changes go to your "wp-content" channel.

*I'm also working to make this plugin multisite-friendly.*

Please use [the Issues section of this plugin's GitHub repo](https://github.com/bamadesigner/rock-the-slackbot/issues) to suggest features, like other notification events.

**A Slack account is required to use this plugin** and is free to use for as long as you want and with an unlimited number of people. [Visit the Slack website](https://slack.com/) to learn more and sign up.
